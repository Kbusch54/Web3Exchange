              A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a type of organization that operates through smart contracts on a blockchain network. In the context of a DeFi exchange, the DAO can be used to govern and manage the operations of the exchange.
              When users trade on the exchange, trading fees are generated. These fees can be collected by the DAO and distributed to the holders of the DAO tokens, similar to how dividends are paid to shareholders in a traditional company. This distribution can be done automatically through smart contracts, ensuring that the process is transparent and trustless.
            </p>
            <p>
              DAO token holders can also participate in the governance of the exchange through a voting system. They can vote on proposals such as changes to the trading fee structure, the addition of new trading pairs, or changes to the DAO's distribution mechanism.
              With Theseus DAO each stake holder is given Minoans which show your stake in the DAO. The more Minoans you have the more voting power you have. The DAO will be governed by the community and will be a place where the community can come together to discuss and vote on proposals.
              Such as the addition of new assets, changes to the trading fee structure, and changes to the distribution mechanism.
              As well as putting maximum and minimums on all the loan pools of the exchange for every asset. This will help to keep the exchange safe, secure and user friendly.</p>
            <p>
              When a new asset and lending pool is cretaed for the exchange the DAO will vote on the maximum and minimum loan amounts for that asset, as well as the interest rate for that asset. 
              The DAO will also be the first staker of the any new pool. The DAO will also recieve percentage of liquidations left over after paying the loan pools back and the liquidator fee.

          <h1 className="text-center text-xl"> Minoan Exchange: A Perpetual Defi Exchange</h1>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            The Minoan Exchange is a perpetual defi exchange that allows users to invest USDC and receive ERC20 pool tokens in return. These pool tokens are proportional to the user's investment compared to
            the rest of the pool at that time. The Minoan Exchange includes loan pools called Ariadne pools, which allow users to borrow USDC with interest set by the corresponding Ariadne DAO.
            In this white paper, we will explore the functionalities of the Minoan Exchange protocol in detail.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Loan Pools (Ariadne Pools)</h3>
          <p>
            The Minoan Exchange has a loan pool for each individual stock asset, called Ariadne pools. Users can invest USDC in these pools and receive ERC20 pool tokens proportional to their investment.
            They can use funds in each loan pool to borrow USDC with interest, set by the individual DAOs of the corresponding loan pool. The interest is charged to a block timestamp set by the pool,
            with a fixed percentage set by the pool. Users must maintain the minimum margin requirement (MMR) of USDC held in the vault contract via the trade ID for the specific trade the user executed.
            The loaner can repay parts of the loan at any time. The user can add leverage on the position, which will borrow more funds. If the user does not meet the MMR at any time, the position is subject to liquidation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users who provide liquidity via the loan pools earn USDC by investors who trade on the exchange, trading fees, and loan payments. A liquidity provider can sell back their ERC20 loan pool
          tokens to the protocol at any time and receive a proportional amount of USDC to the total amount held versus their stake. As long as the pool maintains stability, set by the loan pool's
          DAO aka Ariadne DAO for the specific asset, there is a staking reward to be claimed after a certain amount of time, determined by the DAO. This can only be claimed if the staker staked
          their USDC in the previous snapshot. The pool increases in value when a user of the exchange aka an investor and borrower pays loan payments and from trading fees. A certain percentage
          of these (determined by the DAO) will be sent to the vault contract, and the snapshot struct on the staking contract will reflect the USDC rewards amount. All unclaimed rewards are sent
          back to the staking contract upon the next snapshot interval. The loan pool can lose value via when a borrower 'wins' or sells their position for a higher amount. If the loan pool is drained
          to a certain degree, the protocol will activate the insurance fund at which point the debts owed to an investor will come from there. Then some of the rewards in the future will go to replenish
          the USDC used from the insurance fund for that loan pool.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">Vault Contract</h3>
          <p>
          The Minoan Exchange's vault contract holds all funds not locked into a loan pool (Ariadne pool). If a user wants to use the exchange, the user must first deposit USDC in the vault. The vault will
          keep track of all balances. When a user deposits funds, it goes into a mapping called availableBalances. This can be used as collateral and locked if a user decides to use the exchange. Other balances 
          the vault keeps track of are tradeBalance, which is the amount loaned from the loan pool, tradeCollateral, which is the collateral set aside for a specific trade and loan MMR, poolOutstandingLoans, which 
          keeps track of USDC loaned from a specific loan pool, tradeInterest, which keeps track of specific
          In addition to its other functionalities, the vault contract can also handle liquidation of positions. If a user does not maintain the minimum margin requirement for their position, their collateral can be
          liquidated, which involves selling off the collateral and using the proceeds to pay back the loan. The liquidation is triggered automatically by the smart contract when the margin requirement is breached.</p>
          <p>Furthermore, the vault contract is also responsible for managing the insurance fund. If a loan pool becomes insolvent and the debts cannot be covered by the pool's funds, the insurance fund will be used
          to cover the remaining debts. DAO holders' capital is used to fund the insurance fund, and any excess funds above the maximum capacity will be added to the treasury. If the DAO determines it appropriate,
          a percentage of the treasury funds may be distributed as dividends to the DAO holders.
          </p>  
          <p>
            Overall, the Minoan Exchange protocol offers a comprehensive and robust perpetual decentralized exchange experience, allowing users to borrow and lend funds with interest, trade a variety of assets, and
          stake their holdings to earn rewards. The protocol's design ensures stability and security for all users, while the involvement of the Theseus DAO and Ariadne DAOs provide a mechanism for community governance and decision-making.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">The exchange contract </h3>
          <p>
            Allows users and the vault contract to open a position on a specific AMM of the asset they wish to bet on, which generates a unique tradeId in bytes form. The position is added to a struct with
          relevant information and added to the positions array. Users can close out positions, add or remove liquidity, and add or remove leverage through the exchange contract, which updates the struct and positions array accordingly.
          Each AMM contract is unique to the asset it represents and calculates current funding rate, cummulative notional, timestamp, block number, total position size, quote asset reserve, base asset reserve, start index price, final
          index price, and more. The AMM funding rate is calculated every time the exchange contract interacts and snapshots are updated at the end of each interval period.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-bold">DAO&apos;s</h3>
          <p>
            Ariadne DAOs correspond to specific loan pools and underlying assets, controlled by stakers who can set various parameters such as max leverage, minimum margin requirements, rewards percentage, max loan amount, loan interest rate,
          and reward period. The Theseus DAO controls the max and min values for each variable to prevent unappealing loan pools, manages trading fees and insurance fund, and deploys new loan pools and AMMs. The Minoan Exchange is on Goreli 
          chain and uses the ChainAPI oracle for real-time data. The USDC is specific to the protocol and can be obtained via a faucet on the site. Automatic liquidation bots are used instead of user-run ones for showcasing the protocol.
